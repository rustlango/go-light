// 3 main Go Features

// 1. Go is strong and statically typed language programming language
// Types have to be specified at compile time - not at runtime

// 2. Fast
// Go programs have a fast compilation time. They compile fast.

//3. Go has a Garabage collector but instead of going the error-prone route of manually
// conducting memory management - it does it automatically but it is not as bloated as a 
// dynamic typed language hence why it is perfromant.
// It has an automatic Garabage collection
// go compiler automatically alocates and deallocates memory of data after it's use
// or lifetime (as rustaceans would call it)
